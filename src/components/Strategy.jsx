                        <p> People share their biodata using different formats. Some people share doc file, some share excel sheets, some share PDFs, some people share their photos separately. </p>
                             
                        <p> Secondly, many people donâ€™t even know what to write in the biodata. </p>
                        
                        <p> Another problem is you cannot edit your biodata once you have shared and also you do not have any control over whom to share your biodata with. </p>

                        <p> Firstep aims at solving this problem. It helps you create beautiful biodata which is easy to edit and share.</p>
